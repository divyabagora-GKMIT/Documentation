# **Business Use Case**

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** provides a centralized platform for handling all employee-related operations within the organization.

- **Centralized Employee Management**  
  The system maintains all employee information in one place, allowing easy creation, updates, and maintenance of records.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Access to sensitive employee data is restricted to authorized users such as Admins and HR staff.  
  Regular employees can only view or edit their own profiles or general information.

- **Department Management**  
  The system enables the creation and organization of departments, helping HR and Admin users track which employees belong to which department.

- **Project Management**  
  HR and Admin users can assign employees to specific projects, making it simple to see who is working on what.


- **System Efficiency & Accuracy**  
  The EMS reduces manual HR work and helps maintain accurate, up-to-date information throughout the organization.
